The

command helps you to find mirrors with snapshots synced with the main

is interactive, the questions (get a new copy of mirror file, which
countries to download from, save countries list, which protocol, path
de download sets, which plateform, which sets and finally which
mirror) try to be as straightforward as those from the OpenBSD install
and upgrade scripts.
